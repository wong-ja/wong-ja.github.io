Butterfly Species Classification Using Transfer Learning with ResNet50;Achieved a 69.3% training and 72.4% validation accuracy by training a custom convolutional neural network (SimpleButterflyCNN) model to classify 9,000+ butterfly images across 75 species. Applied transfer learning with the ResNet50, significantly improving classification results to a 96.7% training and 91.8% validation accuracy (Precision: 0.92, Recall: 0.91, F1-score: 0.91, Support: 1300), amplifying generalization accuracy.;butterfly.png;https://github.com/wong-ja/ML_Butterfly_Classification_CNN_ResNet50;Python, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Torchvision, Pillow, TQDM, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn;"{""Project Presentation"":""https://github.com/wong-ja/ML_Butterfly_Classification_CNN_ResNet50/blob/main/Presentation_II_(10-15min).pdf""}";Spring 2025
Random Forest Analysis of Health and Poverty Dynamics in the U.S. (2015-2025);Synthesized and cleaned 35,000+ multi-source US health, poverty and population records (Google PDFM, County Health Rankings) with complex joins, data mappings, and missing data remediation. Built and evaluated multi-target Random Forest regression models (scikit-learn), using imputation and feature importance to identify smoking rates as the top predictor of poor mental & physical health days.;demographics.png;https://github.com/wong-ja/SD_Health_Poverty_Dynamics_2015-2025;Python, Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, DuckDB;"{""Project Presentation"":""https://github.com/wong-ja/SD_Health_Poverty_Dynamics_2015-2025/blob/main/present-fin.pdf""}";Spring 2025
Specialty Candy Shop: Data-Driven Plan TO Prevent Inventory Shortages;Integrated SQL Server data tables spanning logistics, sales, targets, and product information to find optimization strategies and critical operational issues.
